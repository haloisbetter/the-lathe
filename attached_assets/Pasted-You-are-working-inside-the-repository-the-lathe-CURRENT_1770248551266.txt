You are working inside the repository `the-lathe`.

CURRENT STATE
-------------
• lathe/server.py is live and stable
• Refusal format is finalized and correct:
  {
    "refusal": true,
    "reason": "...",
    "details": "...",
    "results": []
  }
• All 63 tests are passing
• OpenWebUI is NOT wired yet
• Lathe is deterministic and guardrail-safe

NEXT GOAL
---------
Make Lathe feel *native* to OpenWebUI without weakening any guarantees.

STEP 1 — OpenWebUI Tool Compatibility Layer (NO UI YET)
-------------------------------------------------------
Add a **single compatibility adjustment** so OpenWebUI function-calling
can consume Lathe responses without adapters.

Rules:
• DO NOT change the refusal schema
• DO NOT change existing tests
• DO NOT add new dependencies
• DO NOT add business logic
• ONLY normalize output shape when needed

What to do:
• Ensure every successful /agent response always includes:
  - "results": []  (even on success)
• This allows OpenWebUI tools to treat success and refusal uniformly
• Refusals already comply — success must now match

Acceptance:
• tests/test_agent_contract.py still passes
• pytest -q passes
• No CLI behavior changes

STEP 2 — Minimal OpenWebUI Tool Handshake (Code Only)
-----------------------------------------------------
Add a small helper (new file allowed) that documents, in code, the
expected OpenWebUI → Lathe payload and response contract.

Rules:
• NO documentation files
• NO README changes
• NO comments explaining OpenWebUI UI steps
• Code only, preferably a small schema / validator / example module

Purpose:
• Acts as a single source of truth for the agent contract
• Makes future OpenWebUI wiring trivial
• Zero runtime impact

DELIVERABLE
-----------
• Updated server success responses include "results"
• One small helper/module capturing the OpenWebUI ↔ Lathe contract
• All tests green

NON-GOALS
---------
• No UI configuration
• No OpenWebUI screenshots
• No new endpoints
• No refactors

IMPORTANT
---------
If something *feels* like business logic, stop.
This step is about *shape*, not *behavior*.

Proceed.
