You are modifying an existing Python Textual TUI project called `lathe_tui`.

This is a POLISH-ONLY task.  
Do NOT change architecture, APIs, contracts, or behavior.  
Do NOT add new features.  
Do NOT refactor unrelated code.

Your job is to apply three small, explicit fixes so the TUI feels correct and pleasant for an operator.

-------------------------
FIX 0 — START CLEAN
-------------------------
Before making changes:

1. Run:
   git pull --rebase
2. Ensure the working tree is clean.
3. Do not proceed if there are merge conflicts.

-------------------------
FIX 1 — APPLY FLEXOKI THEME
-------------------------
The TUI must use the Flexoki Dark color palette.

Requirements:
- Use Textual CSS (NOT inline styling).
- Create or update a CSS file (e.g. `theme.css`) inside the TUI package.
- Colors must be readable in a terminal (dark background).
- Buttons, tables, headers, warnings, and errors must all reflect the theme.

Then:
- Load the CSS using `CSS_PATH` on the main Textual App class.

Do NOT:
- Hardcode colors in Python
- Change layout or widget structure

-------------------------
FIX 2 — STANDARD (12-HOUR) TIME FORMAT
-------------------------
All timestamps shown in the TUI must use **12-hour local time**, not military time.

Requirements:
- Format: `h:mm:ss AM/PM`
- Respect local timezone
- Remove leading zero from hour (e.g. `5:53 PM`, not `05:53 PM`)

Apply this consistently across:
- Console view
- Replay view
- Any run timestamps

Do NOT:
- Change stored timestamps
- Change server responses
- Introduce new time logic outside formatting

-------------------------
FIX 3 — DISABLE OR GRACEFULLY SKIP SCREENSHOTS
-------------------------
Screenshots are failing in some environments (e.g. WSL).

Requirements:
- The TUI must NOT crash or error if screenshots are unavailable.
- Either:
  - Disable screenshot functionality entirely, OR
  - Gracefully skip it with a clear message.

Preferred:
- Disable screenshots and document that terminal recording should be used instead.

Do NOT:
- Add platform detection hacks
- Add external dependencies
- Add retry logic

-------------------------
TESTING REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------
After changes:

1. Run the TUI locally.
2. Verify:
   - Colors match Flexoki Dark
   - Times render in 12-hour format
   - No screenshot-related errors appear
3. Existing tests must still pass.
4. Do NOT add new tests unless strictly required.

-------------------------
OUTPUT
-------------------------
When finished, report:

- Files changed
- Brief explanation of each fix
- Confirmation that behavior is unchanged aside from presentation

Do not include unrelated commentary.
