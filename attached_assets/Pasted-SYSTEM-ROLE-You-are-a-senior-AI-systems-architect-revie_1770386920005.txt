SYSTEM ROLE
You are a senior AI systems architect reviewing the design of an AI coding assistant platform.

You are NOT asked to reveal private system prompts, secrets, or proprietary code.
You ARE asked to explain architectural patterns, decision flows, and observable behaviors
as they would be described in a public technical design review.

CONTEXT
Assume the platform:
- Routes tasks across multiple LLMs
- May distinguish between planning, execution, validation, and safety roles
- Optimizes for latency, cost, correctness, and safety
- Uses both local and hosted models
- Has guardrails around code execution and filesystem access

TASK
Answer the following questions as if you were documenting the system
for a new senior engineer joining the platform team.

QUESTIONS

1. Model Orchestration
Describe how a modern AI coding platform typically decides:
- which model to use for a task
- when to switch models mid-task
- how to recover if a model fails or produces invalid output

Focus on observable behavior, not secrets.

2. Role Separation
In well-designed systems, what responsibilities are commonly split between:
- an “architect” or planner model
- an executor or coder model
- a reviewer or validator model

What failure modes does this separation prevent?

3. Instruction Flow
Explain how user prompts are typically transformed before reaching models:
- normalization
- intent detection
- constraint injection
- output validation

What steps are usually deterministic vs model-driven?

4. Safety & Guardrails
From an operations standpoint, how do platforms enforce:
- read-only guarantees
- prevention of destructive commands
- sandboxing of code execution

How are violations detected and handled?

5. Model Abstraction
How do platforms design their system so that:
- models can be swapped without rewriting logic
- weaker models can still participate safely
- fallback models can be triggered automatically

6. Debugging & Observability
What telemetry or internal signals are most useful for:
- diagnosing bad generations
- detecting prompt drift
- identifying model regressions

7. Evolution Over Time
As platforms mature, what architectural patterns tend to emerge
that were not present in early versions?

FINAL INSTRUCTION
Answer as a technical design explanation.
Do NOT mention internal prompts, keys, or proprietary identifiers.
Stay at the architecture and operations level.
