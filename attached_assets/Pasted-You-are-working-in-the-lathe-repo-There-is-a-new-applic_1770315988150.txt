You are working in the-lathe repo. There is a new application layer under lathe_app/ that provides:
- run_request(...)
- execute_proposal(run_id, dry_run=True|False)
- list_runs()
- load_run(run_id)

Goal: expose the *application layer* via a thin HTTP server so OpenWebUI can:
1) create runs (propose/think/context/rag)
2) execute a proposal run explicitly

Constraints:
- Do NOT modify any lathe/* kernel behavior.
- Keep lathe_app as the only place state + side effects exist.
- HTTP server must be standard library only (like existing lathe/server.py).
- Responses must be JSON only and follow the existing refusal semantics:
  refusal: true (boolean), reason, details, results (always array).
- Success responses must always include results: [] even if unused.
- Server must never return tracebacks.

Deliverables:
1) Add new server file: lathe_app/server.py (or lathe/server_app.py) that exposes:
   - POST /agent
     Request body: { intent, task, why, model? }
     Behavior: calls lathe_app.run_request(...)
     Response: RunRecord serialized to JSON plus "results": []
   - POST /execute
     Request body: { run_id, dry_run? }
     Behavior: calls lathe_app.execute_proposal(...)
     Response: ExecutionResult serialized to JSON plus "results": []
   - GET /health returning JSON { "ok": true }
   - GET /runs returning list_runs() output
   - GET /runs/<id> returning load_run(id)

2) Add a small serializer module if needed:
   lathe_app/http_serialization.py:
   - to_jsonable_runrecord(...)
   - to_jsonable_execution_result(...)
   Ensure dataclasses and Path objects serialize cleanly.

3) Add tests:
   tests/app/test_http_app_server.py that verifies:
   - POST /agent returns run_id and does NOT apply changes
   - POST /execute with dry_run=true does not mutate fixtures
   - POST /execute with dry_run=false attempts apply (use temp dir fixture)
   - missing fields return structured refusal
   - GET /health returns ok
   - no tracebacks are returned

4) Provide a minimal OpenWebUI tool JSON definitions in a comment at top of server file:
   Tool 1: lathe_agent calls POST /agent
   Tool 2: lathe_execute calls POST /execute

Acceptance:
- pytest -q passes (must increase test count appropriately).
- Server runs and responds on port 5000 or 5001.
- Tool responses are stable and strictly JSON.

Proceed to implement with minimal changes and maximum determinism.
