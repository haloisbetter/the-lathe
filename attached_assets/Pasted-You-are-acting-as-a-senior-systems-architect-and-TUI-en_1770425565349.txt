You are acting as a senior systems architect and TUI engineer.

You are working on a project called **The Lathe**, an AI orchestration system with a strict architectural law:

- `lathe/` is a pure, stateless reasoning kernel
- `lathe_app/` owns all state, I/O, orchestration, workspaces, and execution
- No UI, TUI, or side effects may touch `lathe/`
- All interaction must occur through existing HTTP APIs exposed by `lathe_app.server`

Your task in THIS STEP is NOT to write any code.

Your task is to produce a **single, powerful, one-page document** titled:

📄 **Lathe TUI Architecture & Operator Contract**

This document will act as the binding contract for any future TUI implementation.

---

### 🎯 Purpose of the TUI (must be explicit)

The TUI exists to:
- Observe Lathe operations
- Inspect past runs deterministically
- Control approvals within trust constraints
- Never reason, decide, or bypass validators

State clearly:
- The TUI is an *operator console*, not an agent
- The TUI is read-heavy, write-light
- The TUI cannot invent context, files, or actions

---

### 🧩 Patterns (MANDATORY)

The TUI MUST implement **only** these two patterns:

#### Pattern A — Worker Console (Live View)
- Shows active and recent runs
- Displays intent, workspace, model tier, trust level
- Shows validation / refusal / escalation status
- Read-only by default

#### Pattern C — Run Replay / Debugger
- Load a historical RunRecord
- Step through:
  - normalization
  - intent resolution
  - model selection
  - speculative escalation
  - validation (including context echo)
  - approval or refusal
- Deterministic replay only (no mutation)

Explicitly state:
- Pattern B (prompt builder) is OUT OF SCOPE
- No inline editing of prompts or files

---

### 🔌 Data Sources (API-ONLY)

List the **exact API surfaces** the TUI is allowed to use, such as:
- `GET /runs`
- `GET /runs/{id}`
- `GET /runs/stats`
- `GET /health/summary`
- `GET /workspace/stats`
- `POST /runs/{id}/approve` (if trust allows)

State clearly:
- No filesystem access
- No direct git operations
- No subprocess execution
- No kernel imports

---

### 🔐 Trust & Safety Guarantees

The contract MUST state:
- Trust policies are evaluated server-side only
- The TUI may *request* an action, never assume permission
- Trust level 4 still cannot bypass workspace boundaries
- All refusals must be shown verbatim with WHY records

---

### 🧠 Observability Rules

The TUI must:
- Display decisions and reasons
- Never display raw prompts
- Never expose model internals
- Never retry or reframe on its own

---

### 🖥️ UI Scope & Constraints

Define:
- TUI runs as a **local worker**
- Uses a Python TUI framework (Textual preferred)
- Event loop is UI-only
- Polling or SSE allowed, but no push logic in kernel

Explicitly forbid:
- Any business logic in the TUI
- Any fallback logic
- Any model selection logic

---

### 📜 Output Requirements

Your output MUST be:
- One page
- Structured with headings
- Clear, authoritative, and enforceable
- Written as a contract, not a tutorial

DO NOT:
- Write code
- Propose features beyond Pattern A and C
- Suggest kernel changes
- Suggest prompt-based UIs

End the document with a section titled:

**“Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)”**

---

### ⛔ Stop Condition (CRITICAL)

After producing the document:
- STOP
- Do NOT scaffold files
- Do NOT write Python
- Do NOT propose next steps

The next step will be given explicitly by the operator.

Begin now.
