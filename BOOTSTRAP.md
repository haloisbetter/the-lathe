# BOOTSTRAP STRATEGY

Current Bootstrap Provider:
- OpenHands (external agentic system)

Role:
- Scaffold The Lathe
- Implement early milestones
- Execute constrained coding tasks

Constraints:
- Bootstrap provider has NO authority over:
  - Product direction
  - Task policy
  - Long-term architecture

Exit Condition:
- The Lathe must eventually be able to:
  - Parse a project spec
  - Generate a task plan
  - Execute tasks using internal agents

Once achieved:
- OpenHands becomes optional or removed
